# Custom Error Pages

These are the Node9 404 and 500 error pages for the site.

I spent about 5 minutes making these. I hope they help people with ideas for their own custom error pages.



## How to Use

Depending on whether this is for a local server or a web server, the process is different. For a Linux VPS, go to your Apache configuration and follow these steps:

or for Nginx:

[How to Configure Nginx to Use Custom Error Pages on Ubuntu 22.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-nginx-to-use-custom-error-pages-on-ubuntu-22-04)

For web hosts, simply find the area for custom pages and set them accordingly once uploaded.
